title: Invest in the Ruler platform
intro: Hold the RULER token and earn a portion of Ruler revenue
---

The RULER platform incentivizes the long-term value accrual to the RULER token, by sharing platform revenue with RULER holders.

To participate, simply buy RULER token on SushiSwap, and then deposit it into the xRULER vault on the platform.

As receipt for depositing RULER into the vault, you will receive xRULER tokens. The amount of xRULER tokens you hold will remain fixed, but their value in terms of RULER will appreciate over time, as platform fees are directed to the vault.

**Questions from Matt:**

- What percentage of fees goes to stakers?

**Comments from Matt:**

- I can't think of any benefit to introducing the concept of "xRULER" to the user. It's simply a technical thing; i.e. that we have to issue them an appreciating asset as receipt for their deposit. But the only thing that matters to them is how many RULER tokens they own.
