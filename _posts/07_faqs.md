- **Where are my RC and RR tokens? I don’t see them in MetaMask.**

To see these tokens in your MetaMask wallet, you’d need to add them manually, using the token contract address that you can find in the minting or buying transaction on Etherscan. It’s generally unnecessary, however, to add them to MetaMask; the Ruler website can see them just fine when you interact with the site.

- **Do I really lose my collateral if I pay my loan late?**

Yes. Since the Ruler platform is operated by smart contracts on the Ethereum network, the rules are enforced by software. If a loan is unpaid by expiration, the protocol will distribute the collateral to the liquidity providers.

- **Someone said my loan has a “built-in put option”. What does that mean?**

“Put options” provide protection against downside movement of an asset’s price. In the case that the value of your collateral were to collapse, as a borrower you could always choose not to repay your loan, keeping the loan proceeds. This downside protection against a fall in your collateral value is effectively a put option.
