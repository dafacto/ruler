The Ruler project was founded by the same team that founded and operate the **Cover Protocol** peer-to-peer [coverage platform](https://app.coverprotocol.com/). Although anonymous, the team has a demonstrated track record of innovative vision and technical capability necessary to develop and operate a secure DeFi financial platform.

As testiment to the credibility of the team, highly-regard crypto participant “Sifu” made a one million USD investment into the project, in March of 2021.

Certain decisions in the operations of the Ruler project are voted on by liquidity providers in the RULER-ETH SushiSwap pool. For example, voting on the addition of new collateral types.
