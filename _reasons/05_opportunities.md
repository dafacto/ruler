intro: Interesting earning opportunities arising from market dynamics

The mechanism by which lending is implemented in Ruler creates a wealth of opportunities for market participants. 

Since loans are issued when those wishing to borrow DAI sell their RC tokens into a liquidity pool, this creates a supply and demand dynamic that establishes a DAI-RC "price", or interest rate.

**High borrow rates** — When there is more demand for DAI than RC tokens, this means there's a high demand for loans, and the interest rate will increase. When there is positive interest rates, lenders can "sell" their DAI for RC tokens, capturing both the current borrow interest rate, *and* then earning the current farming yield if they choose to farm their RC tokens.

**Negative borrow rates** — When there is more demand for RC tokens than DAI, a situation of negative borrow rates can arise. In such situations, an investor can {**do what? What is the play when there's negative rates?**}
