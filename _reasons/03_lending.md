title: Lend USD on Ruler
intro: Earn interest rate and farming yield
---

Ruler incentives holders of USD (DAI) to provide loans in the peer-to-peer marketplace through two mechanisms:

1. **Direct lending** — By direct lending of DAI, a lender captures the loan interest rate yield.
2. **Providing liquidity** — By providing liquidity to the Ruler AMM pools that are used to facilitate loans (see "Borrowing"), Ruler allows the associated "LP tokens" to be staked and farm, earning the liquidity provider a return in RULER tokens.


### Direct lending

To lend DAI to borrowers on the Ruler platform, you can either "buy" RC tokens in the Ruler AMM pool at the current market rate using the "Lend" feature, or you can "mint" RC tokens on a one-to-one basis with DAI through the "Deposit". 

What's interesting, is that you're not lending to a *particular* borrower, but rather interacting with the liquidity pool that's used to fund *all* borrower loans.

Once a lender holds RC tokens, he or she may further be interested in farming, as described below.

### Providing liquidity

To provide liquidity, a lender deposits DAI using the "Deposit" tab, and receipts one RC token in return

1. Deposit DAI, and receive back one RC token per DAI. Note that contrary to "lending", a depositor only gets one RC token per DAI. Depending on the market conditions—i.e. positive borrow interest rate—it would be advantage to use the "Lend" feature to buy, rather than mint, a higher number of RC tokens for a given amount of DAI.
2. Visit the relevant liquidity pool (linked to from Ruler), and deposit the RC tokens into the pool. The Balancer website allows one to deposit a single asset—i.e. the RC token—into the pool.

In the case of defaulted loans, Ruler liquidity providers receive the foreited collateral. Whether this is beneficial or detrimental to LPs, depends on the price of the collateral at the time of expiry. When considering to be a Ruler LP, one must consider the risk that collateral values decline, and borrowers choose to default.

### Unwinding a lending position

As the current lending term gets closer to expiry, loan holders will increasingly sell their DAI back into the pool for the RC tokens they need to pair with their RR tokens for loan repayment. This should drive the price of RC tokens back towards 1 DAI, such that LP providers can redeem their own RC tokens for 1 DAI each.

**Questions from Matt:**

- Why would a lender ever "deposit" instead of "lending". It seems you'd always lose the current lending APR by depositing?

### Farming

Once a lender's held RC tokens are deposited into the relevant Ruler AMM pool, the receipt pool LP tokens can be staked on the "Farming" page at Ruler, to earn RULER rewards!
